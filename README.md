Mint.com Keyboard Shortcuts
===========================

Mint.com is great in a number of respects, but somewhat lacking in keyboard shortcuts. 
This user script adds a few simple keyboard shortcuts so you can work with Mint a little faster, in Chrome anyway.

#Installation
1. Download [mint-keyboard-shortcuts.userscript.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schvenk/mint-keyboard-shortcuts/master/src/js/mint-keyboard-shortcuts.js) _<-- Just visit that link and then save to your desktop as plain text. Or you can check out the repository if that's your thing._
2. In Chrome, go to Window > Extensions
3. Drag the userscript.js file onto the Chrome window.
4. The script should now be installed, and will run any time you're on Mint's Transactions screen.

#Usage
* With a transaction selected, **press E or Ctrl-E to open its editor.** Press again (or C or Ctrl-C) to close without saving.
* With the editor open, **press S or Ctrl-S to save and close** the transaction.
* Press **T** to toggle Tax-Related, **R** to toggle Reimbursable, **B** to toggle Business.

That's all for now. Easy enough to add others; if you're non-technical and ask nicely, I might even do it for you :)
